This code is an example of how we load 3D models to a website app using `Three.js` and `Next.js`.

Here, I use [Littlest Tokyo](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1AGwX) model by [Glen Fox](https://www.artstation.com/glenatron).  I load the model by using the [example code](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_keyframes.html) on `Three.js` site. GLModel and Draco decoder are placed in `public` folder.

## Run the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btt-17/nextjs-threejs
cd nextjs-threejs
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
